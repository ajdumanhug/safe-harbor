# Safe Harbor

# Guidelines for Safe Harbor and Responsible Disclosure

# 1. Introduction
The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) is committed to fostering a secure digital ecosystem in the Philippines. These guidelines aim to provide a structured approach to vulnerability reporting, ensuring ethical coordination between security researchers and affected parties while offering safe harbor protections to good-faith security researchers.

# 2. Scope
These guidelines apply to security researchers, ethical hackers, cybersecurity professionals, government agencies, private organizations, and other entities handling vulnerabilities within the Philippine jurisdiction.

# Safe Harbor Protection for Security Researchers
# 3. Protection for Good-Faith Research
Security researchers acting in good faith, within the defined scope, and in accordance with the guidelines shall be protected to the fullest extent permissible by law arising from their security testing activities, except in cases involving gross negligence, willful misconduct, or actions beyond the permitted scope.

A researcher is considered to act in good faith if they:
* Do not exploit a vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate its existence.
* Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before following the responsible disclosure process outlined in these guidelines.
* Do not cause harm, disrupt operations, or engage in unauthorized data exfiltration.
* Cooperate in remediation efforts by providing all necessary information regarding the vulnerability.

# 4. Exclusions from Safe Harbor Protection
The following actions void safe harbor protections:
* Malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities.
* Unauthorized data access, theft, or modification.
* Ransomware or extortion-based disclosures.
* Public disclosure of vulnerabilities without following the responsible disclosure process.
* Intentional disruption of services.

# Responsible Disclosure Process
# 5. Reporting a Vulnerability
Security researchers should follow these steps when reporting a vulnerability:
* Identify the Affected Party – Verify the ownership of the system or service where the vulnerability was found.
* Submit a Detailed Report – The report should include:
  * Affected system, service, or application.
  * Technical description of the vulnerability, including proof-of-concept (PoC) if applicable.
  * Steps to reproduce the issue.
  * Suggested remediation measures.
* Submit via Official Contact Channels – Use the affected party’s vulnerability disclosure program (VDP), bug bounty program, or official security contact (e.g., security@domain.com). If unavailable, report directly to DICT at [security@dict.gov.ph].

# 6. Initial Response Time
* The affected party must acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report within 5 business days.
* If no response is received, the researcher may escalate the issue to DICT for intervention.

# 7. Remediation Timeline
* The affected party should develop and implement a fix within 30 calendar days from the initial report.
* The affected party must maintain communication with the researcher and provide updates on remediation progress.

# 8. Coordinated Public Disclosure
If the affected party fails to acknowledge or respond within 30 days or does not implement a fix within **90 days**, the researcher has the right to publicly disclose the vulnerability while ensuring responsible disclosure practices (e.g., withholding exploit details that could lead to active exploitation).

Prior to any public disclosure, the security researcher shall exercise coordination by submitting a draft of the intended disclosure to both the DICT and the affected organization. The draft shall include the proposed publication date and may omit or redact exploit code or other sensitive technical details.

The DICT and the affected organization shall have five (5) business days from receipt of the draft to request reasonable redactions, exclusion of exploit code, or adjustments to protect operational or national security interests. The affected organization may also use this window to coordinate internally with its risk management and strategy teams to assess potential impact.

The security researcher is expected to negotiate in good faith regarding any requested changes or delays, provided that such coordination shall not unreasonably restrict the researcher’s right to disclose or the public’s right to be informed of security risks.

The DICT may mediate in cases of dispute or delay and, where appropriate, issue advisories or notifications to affected entities to encourage or accelerate remediation and protect the public interest.

# Ethical Considerations and Best Practices
# 9. Guidelines for Ethical Security Research
Researchers should adhere to the following ethical principles:
* Minimize risk: Do not conduct security tests that may disrupt operations.
* Confidentiality: Do not access, store, or share sensitive data.
* Cooperation: Work with the affected party to ensure a proper resolution.
* Legal compliance: Follow all relevant laws and regulations.

# 10. Recognition and Incentives
* Organizations may choose to provide acknowledgments, rewards, or bug bounties for responsible disclosures.
* DICT will maintain a Hall of Ethical Hackers to recognize researchers contributing to national cybersecurity.

# Enforcement and Legal Framework
# 11. DICT’s Role in Vulnerability Disclosure
* DICT will act as a mediator in disputes regarding vulnerability handling.
* DICT may issue advisories or recommend regulatory actions for non-cooperative entities.
* DICT will coordinate with law enforcement agencies in case of malicious exploitation.

# 12. Legal Protections and Liabilities
* Researchers adhering to these guidelines are protected from prosecution under applicable laws.
* Entities failing to remediate vulnerabilities on time may face regulatory scrutiny or public advisories.

# Conclusion
These guidelines establish a structured approach to ethical vulnerability disclosure while protecting researchers acting in good faith. Compliance with responsible disclosure processes strengthens national cybersecurity and fosters a safer digital environment for all stakeholders.
